DKPro Core - Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) typesystem and wrapper for RST parser

## Prerequisities

- You need a local working copy of RST parser [1]; the copy can be found e.g. here: 
https://github.com/habernal/feng-hirst-rst-parser-acl-2014

## Examples

- There are some examples under src/test

- You only need to point the RSTAnnotator to the src/ folder of the RST parser

## Problems

- Different segmentation (tokenization) and mapping the RST output back to the tokens; sometimes fails due to normalization etc.
